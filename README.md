# steve_rover

## Installation
**Tested with ROS Melodic running on Ubuntu 18.04.***

**Note**: If you are installing this on a Jetson computer, follow [these instructions](jetson_xavier_nx_setup.md) first to properly it up before doing the rest of the steps.

1. Install [ROS Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu)

2. If you don't already have one, create a catkin workspace by following [this guide](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace)

3. Add your catkin_ws source to your `.bashrc` file.
    ```bash
    echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

4. Clone this repo in `~catkin_ws/src/`. It is recommended that you clone it in SSH instead of HTTPS since you don't to enter a user and password every time you commit. [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

5. Install non-ros dependencies: 
    ```bash
    cd ~catkin_ws/src/steve_rover
    ./installation.sh
    ```

6. Clone the other repos using vcstool. (**Note**: there are two dependency lists, one in SSH and the other in HTTPS. For development, SSH is recommended):
    ```bash
    cd ~catkin_ws/src/
    vcs import < steve_rover/dependencies_ssh.repos
    ```
    All of the dependent repos should now be cloned on the right branches

    * If you need to pull all of the repos at once:
        ```bash
        cd ~catkin_ws/src/
        vcs pull
        ```

    * If you have added a repo and need to add it to the list of dependencies, first clone it, then:
        ```bash
        cd ~catkin_ws/src/
        vcs export > steve_rover/dependencies_ssh.repos
        ```
        **Important**: When modifying the dependency list, make sure that the HTTPS AND SSH lists are identical except for the url prefixes.
        **Important**: This repo should not be in the list since it is already cloned when importing.

7. Install the official ROS package dependencies with rosdep: 
    ```bash
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
    ```
    **Note**: you may need to install rosdep first.<br>
    Command to install rosdep:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python-rosdep
    ```
    Initialize rosdep once after the installation:
    ```bash
    sudo rosdep init
    rosdep update
    ```
    If you need to add and official ROS package as a dependency, you must add it to the `package.xml` of the relevant package.
    
9. Go to the root of the workspace and execute `catkin_make` to compile the packages.

## Launching the Gazebo simulation
To launch the gazebo simulation, execute this command
```bash
roslaunch steve_gazebo steve_mars.launch
```
To view the robot and sensor data in RViz:
```bash
roslaunch steve_viz rviz.launch
```
To view only the rover model without gazebo:
```bash
roslaunch steve_viz model.launch
```
To control the rover with a gamepad:
```bash
roslaunch steve_control teleop_gamepad.launch
```

## IMU Calibration
RTIMULib2 comes with GUI and console based applications to view IMU data and calibrate the accelerometer and magnetometer.
In a terminal, type `RTIMULib` and hit tab twice to see what is available. See [this guide](https://github.com/RTIMULib/RTIMULib2/blob/master/Calibration.pdf) for more information on how to calibrate.

The calibration needs to be done whenever there is a change in the IMU's environment, since the magnetometer is very sensitive to magnetic variations.

Ideally, you'll want to use `RTIMULibCal`, which is uses a command line interface instead of a GUI. That way you can easily do the calibration via SSH. 

**Important**: to avoid an error while doing ellipsoid calibration, you'll want to run `RTIMULibCal` from the `RTEllipsoidFit` folder located where you cloned the RTIMULib2 repo. For example:
```bash
cd ~/dev/RTIMULib2/RTEllipsoidFit/
RTIMULibCal
```
The calibration data will also be saved in that folder with the name `RTIMULib.ini`.

That calibration file can then be converted to a yaml file that the `i2c_imu` ROS package will understand. For more information on how to do that, refer to the [package's documentation](https://github.com/JeremieBourque1/i2c_imu).

## Zed SDK installation
You need drivers to run the Zed that depends on cuda.

Firstly, if not installed, install [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads). Then download and install [ZED SDK **â‰¥ 3.5**](https://www.stereolabs.com/developers/).
